CODE:
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a,b;
    float c;
    a=5;
    b=2;
    c=a+b;
    printf("Sum of %d and %d is %.2f\n",a,b,c);
    c=a*b;
    printf("Product of %d and %d is %.2f\n",a,b,c);
    c=a/b;
    printf("Integer division of %d by %d is %2f\n",a,b,c);
    c=(float)a/b;
    printf("Real division of %d by %d is %.2f\n",a,b,c);
    return 0;
   
}

OUTPUT:
Sum of 5 and 2 is 7.00
Product of 5 and 2 is 10.00
Integer division of 5 by 2 is 2.000000
Real division of 5 by 2 is 2.50
